# DE1-Audio Synthesizer

# Intro
Inspired   by   the   mathematics   of   various   harmonics   in   music,   we   set   out   for   a   project   that deviated   from   the   norm   of   a   hardware   video   game,   and   decided   to   design   and   describe   an digital   synthesizer   on   the   DE1-SoC   board.   Our   design   calls   for   a   functionality   such   that   the   user inputs   three   sequences   of   notes,   and   upon   their   request,   loop   these   sequences   over   one another,   similar   to   a   “launchpad”   that   many   music   producers   use.
